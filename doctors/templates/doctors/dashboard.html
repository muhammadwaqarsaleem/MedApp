<!--
  File: doctors/templates/doctors/dashboard.html
  Purpose:
    - Main doctors user account dashboard page.
    - Composes root-level components (KPIs, quick actions, mini-cards) via single-line includes.
  SOLID & Patterns:
    - SRP: This template only composes UI; it does not fetch or transform data.
    - OCP: New UI variants should be added by passing different context or adding includes, not editing root components.
    - Template Pattern: View provides context; template renders.
